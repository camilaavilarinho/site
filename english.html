					<h1> Hi, </h1>
					<br>
					<p>My name is Camila Vilarinho de Sousa  and  I consider myself a developer by need (This means that I learn depending on the needs of the project). I’m also engaged in initiatives that promote <strong> Entrepreneurship </ strong>, <strong> innovation </ strong> and I love <strong> social entrepreneurship.</strong></p>
					<br>
					<p>I was born in a very small town of Piauí, Brazil and studied all my life there, just went to the capital for the university where I studied <strong> Computer Science </strong>. </p>
					<br>
					<p>In college I started with a ordinary university life, but what I did not know was that the university student status could take me far beyond. </p>
					<br>
					<p>I was part of the Academic Center (CA) of my course helping students to have more representation before the university and it started to cause a change in my way of seeing the world, I could begin to see that I could have a voice and <strong> courage to try to change what bothered me. </strong> </p>
					<br>
					<p>This courage awakened in me a desire to do more and still at university I had the opportunity to be part of the founder group of<a title="AIESEC" href = "http://www.aiesec.org.br/" target = "_blank "> AIESEC </a> in Teresina and be able to bring to the city a cultural diversity and a change of vision needed. AIESEC told me I could be a leader and change the world and I believed it. AIESEC gave me the opportunity to develop skills that I never knew I had, to<strong> lead a team </strong>, to learn how to <strong> deal with problems </ strong> be <strong> resilient </ strong>, <strong> work with deadlines </strong> and meet people from all around the world ... I had a huge growth in this organization and much of what I am today and the will I have to be a better person have been developed there. </p>
					<br>
					<p>The status of university student gave me another opportunity: to be part of the <a title="CHOICE Moviment" href="http://www.choice.org.br/" target="_blank">CHOICE movement</a> which is the largest youth movement engaged in business for social impact in Brazil. We believe it is possible to change the world and addressing the key problems through <strong>business</strong>, generating income and helping the poor. And the role of the ambassador is disclose how to do this through lectures and workshops with students. I was the first ambassador of my state and together with the challenge of getting people to understand what I wanted to talk came a great personal development and the certain that work with business for social impact is what I want to do in life </p>
					<br>
					<p>In early 2015 I did a <strong> social exchange </strong>, where I worked as a volunteer at the NGO <a title="TECHO" href="http://www.techo.org/" target="_blank"> TECHO </a> in Temuco in Chile. There I had contact with a totally different reality from mine, both <strong> cultural </strong> as <strong> social </strong> and it helped me to think a lot about the <strong> Impact </strong> that my actions cause in the world. You can a bit of that experience <a title="exchange blog" href="https://camilaavilarinho.wordpress.com" target="_blank">here</a></p>
					<br>
					<p>Today my search is very personal. I have a special project with myself which is the full assurance that I want to be the change I want to see in the world. </p>
					<br>
					<p>Currently I have devoted myself to acquire some skills that I consider important to be a person and a better professional.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I'm teaching myself <strong> web development</strong> because it is something I like a lot and because I believe that the <strong> technology </strong> is one of the ways in which I will be able to cause the <strong> impact social </strong> I want. </p>
